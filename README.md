## Purposes Of The Project
The purpose of this project is to compile Vrinda Store's 2022 Annual Sales Report, aiming to glean informed customer insights essential for future expansion strategies.

## About Data
The dataset consists of sales transactions spanning 21 columns and over 30,000 rows of valuable data for analysis [Vrinda Store Data](https://github.com/Jamaderibigbe/Vrinda-Store-s-2022-Annual-Sales-Report---Excel/blob/main/Vrinda%20Store%20Data%20Analysis%20%20start.xlsx)

 ## Approach Used
 > We conducted a comprehensive review of all fields/columns to identify and rectify any duplicates and null values. During this examination, we identified discrepancies in the Gender column, encompassing variations such as 'Men', 'Women', 'M', and 'W'. To establish uniformity, we employed the 'Find and Replace' function, substituting 'M' with 'Men' and 'W' with 'Women', thus ensuring consistency across the dataset
> We also observed variations in the 'Quantity' field, including numeric values ('1', '2', '3', '4', '5') as well as text representations ('one', 'two'). To standardize the data, we replaced 'one' with '1' and 'two' with '2'

## Data Processing
> We introduced a new column named 'Age Group' and utilized the IF statement to categorize ages into 'Teenager', 'Adult', and 'Senior' groups.
> We created an additional column named 'Month' and utilized a text function to retrieve the month name in the (mmm) format.

## Data Analysis List
> We generated a pivoted table showcasing monthly transaction sums and order counts, complemented by a corresponding pivoted chart.
We created a pivoted table on Gender and sum of transaction with pivoted

> We crafted a pivoted table detailing order status and order count, accompanied by a corresponding pivoted pie chart.

> We crafted a pivoted table highlighting the top 5 states by total amount, complemented by a corresponding pivoted bar chart.

> We developed a pivoted table categorizing age groups and gender by the percentage of transactions, paired with a corresponding pivoted bar chart.

> We created a pivoted table on channel used for transaction, and counts of orders with pivoted
donot chart alongside.

> Subsequently, we introduced slicers for filtering by months, channel, and category, enhancing our ability to interact with the report page
